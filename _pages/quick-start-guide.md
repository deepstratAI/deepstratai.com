## Welcome to DeepStratAI

This is the logbook for the everyday investor, whom we affectionately call **"Nemo."** The Indian stock market is a vast ocean where large, well-equipped players (Sharks & Whales) often have the upper hand. Our mission is to provide Nemo with the tools and knowledge to navigate these waters.

### Who is Nemo?

Nemo is any retail investor who is emotional, may not fully grasp the risks of the market, and might struggle to differentiate between speculation, trading, and long-term investing. If that sounds like you or someone you know, you're in the right place.

### What is Nemo's Vector?

"Nemo's Vector" is our flagship product concept. It's not a get-rich-quick scheme, but rather a compass designed to guide Nemo on a journey of financial education and empowerment. It will combine data-driven insights with the critical element of an educated "human in the loop" to turn market chaos into a navigable chart.

### How to Get Started

3.  **Learn the Fundamentals:** We believe in building a strong foundation. Our content is structured to help you understand the core concepts of investing, not just chase tips.
