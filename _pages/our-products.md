## Nemo's Vector

**Nemo's Vector** is our flagship concept, designed to be the compass for the everyday investor. It is not a get-rich-quick scheme, but a comprehensive tool that combines data-driven insights with the critical element of an educated "human in the loop." Its goal is to demystify complex financial landscapes and turn market chaos into a navigable chart.

The project is currently under active development.

## Market Sentiment Analyzer (Codename: Sonar)

*(Placeholder for the second product)*

**Sonar** is a planned tool to analyze market sentiment by processing real-time news, social media trends, and financial reports. It aims to provide a simple, visual indicator of the prevailing mood in the market—whether it's driven by fear, greed, or neutrality—helping investors make more informed, less emotional decisions.
