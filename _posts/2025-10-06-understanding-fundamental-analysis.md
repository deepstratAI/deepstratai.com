Fundamental Analysis (FA) is a holistic approach to studying a business. When an investor wishes to invest for the long term (say, 3-5 years), it becomes essential to understand the business from various perspectives.

The core principle is to separate the daily short-term noise in stock prices and concentrate on the underlying business performance. Over the long term, the stock prices of a fundamentally strong company tend to appreciate, thereby creating wealth for its investors. This is a cornerstone of Nemo's Vector.
