This website is an open-source initiative built using the static site generator **Jekyll** and hosted on **GitHub Pages**. This approach was chosen for its speed, security, and simplicity.

Unlike dynamic websites that require databases and complex server-side processing, a Jekyll site is pre-built into a set of static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This makes it incredibly fast to load and highly secure. All our content, including this post, is written in simple Markdown, making it easy to manage and update.
